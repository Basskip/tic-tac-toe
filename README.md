# Tic Tac Toe in JavaScript

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript) curriculum, creating a small Tic-Tac-Toe app to learn some JavaScript

## Things I learned

## Things to work on
* Extension: draw a line through the winning squares
